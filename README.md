This static site is generated using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com). To start development, first install all dependencies:

```
bundle install
```

To test your work, you can spin up a dev server:

```
middleman server
```

To build the static site from the `/source`:

```
middleman build
```

The `/build` directory is not tracked by git.

The configuration file `config.rb` allows you to set your Middleman options.
