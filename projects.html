			<h2>Macronutrient search</h2>

			<p><a href="http://macronutrients.herokuapp.com">Macronutrients on heroku</a></p>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/qsymmachus/macronutrients">Macronutrients repo</a></p>

			<p>I like to keep track of what I eat, but I hate most online nutrition apps. They're filled with ads and usually give me way more information than I actually need. So I decided to make my own.</p>

			<p>Macronutrient search does what it advertises: it returns the macronutrients of a food only. Food "macros" include calorie count, carbohydrates, fat, and protein. You know, the things you actually pay attention to on a nutrition label. </p>

			<p>It's powered by the <a href="http://platform.fatsecret.com/api/">FatSecret API</a> which provides a solid nutritional database. <a href="http://ibrahimmuhammad.com/">Ibrahim Muhammad</a> wrote a nice ruby gem for the API. The app is optimized with database caching; the results of each user query are written to a database by a background job to avoid repeat API requests. Note that background jobs are disabled in the heroku deployed version of the app.

			<p>Roy Lee, Patrick Vilhena, and Eli Shkurkin recently helped me redesign the frontend with the D3.js library. The macronutrients for each results are now visualized in a radar graph.</p>

			<h2>Cluny preambles database</h2>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/qsymmachus/cluny_database">Cluny database repo</a><p>
			<p><a href="files/arenga_types.txt" font-size: 1.25em>arenga_types.txt</a><p>

			<p>In my free time I maintain a SQLite database of preambles (also known as "arengae") from the Cartularies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluny_Abbey">Cluny</a>, 987 to 997.

			<p>Historians are interested in preambles because they are highly rhetorical, and therefore offer us a window into the ideology advanced by a monastery. The database has one table with the following schema:</p>

			<img id="schema" src="img/schema.png"/>

			<p>charter_num refers to the categorization of charters found in Bernard & Bruel, "Recueil des chartes de l'abbaye de Cluny", Paris 1876-1903.
			<p>This database is free for anyone to play around with, if medieval history is your thing. "arenga_types.txt" is a guide to the arenga categories found in the database.</p><br><br><br>
