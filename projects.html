				<h2>BAC Monkey</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.bacmonkey.com">www.bacmonkey.com</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/sea-lions-2014/bac-monkey">BAC Monkey repo</a></p>

				<p>BAC Monkey is a personal tracker for alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. Users can enter the number of drinks they consumed and see their estimated Blood Alcohol Content (BAC %) graphed over time. Caffeine and Nicotine dosage is graphed in milligrams.</p>

				<p>If a user creates an account with BAC monkey, he or she can begin tracking her long term habits. A user's profile page provides their average daily consumption, how they compare to other users, and information on the maximum intake doctors recommend.</p>

				<img class="screenshot" src="img/bac_monkey_profile.png">

				<p>I developed BAC Monkey in Rails along with Patrick Vilhena, Darcey Lachtman, and David Goodman. I was team lead and my particular contribution was the development of the models required to generate the graphs. 

				<p>The classes AlcoholCalc, CaffeineCalc, and NicotineCalc all contain their own formulae for estimating dosage based on the elimination half-life of each substance; caffeine, for example, has an elimination rate of 9% per hour. These classes inherit from a superclass SubstanceCalc which generates a nested array of data points where 'x' is the time measured in 15 minute intervals and 'y' is the calculated dosage. This array is then passed to the front end where it is rendered as a graph using the D3.js library.</p>

				<h2>Macronutrient search</h2>

				<p><a href="http://macronutrients.herokuapp.com">Macronutrients on heroku</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/qsymmachus/macronutrients">Macronutrients repo</a></p>

				<p>I like to keep track of what I eat, but I hate most online nutrition apps. They're filled with ads and usually give me way more information than I actually need. So I decided to make my own.</p>

				<img class="screenshot" src="img/macronutrients.png"/>

				<p>Macronutrient search does what it advertises: it returns the macronutrients of a food only. Food "macros" include calorie count, carbohydrates, fat, and protein. You know, the things you actually pay attention to on a nutrition label. </p>

				<p>It's powered by the <a href="http://platform.fatsecret.com/api/">FatSecret API</a> which provides a solid nutritional database. <a href="http://ibrahimmuhammad.com/">Ibrahim Muhammad</a> wrote a nice ruby gem for the API. The app is optimized with database caching; the results of each user query are written to a database by a background job to avoid repeat API requests. Note that background jobs are disabled in the heroku deployed version of the app.

				<p>Roy Lee, Patrick Vilhena, and Eli Shkurkin recently helped me redesign the frontend with the D3.js library. The macronutrients for each result are now visualized in a radar graph.</p>

				<h2>Cluny preambles database</h2>

				<p><a href="https://github.com/qsymmachus/cluny_database">Cluny database repo</a><p>
				<p><a href="files/arenga_types.txt" font-size: 1.25em>arenga_types.txt</a><p>

				<p>In my free time I maintain a SQLite database of preambles (also known as "arengae") from the Cartularies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluny_Abbey">Cluny</a>, 987 to 997.

				<p>Historians are interested in preambles because they are highly rhetorical, and therefore offer us a window into the ideology advanced by a monastery. The database has one table with the following schema:</p>

				<img id="schema" src="img/schema.png"/>

				<p>charter_num refers to the categorization of charters found in Bernard & Bruel, "Recueil des chartes de l'abbaye de Cluny", Paris 1876-1903.
				<p>This database is free for anyone to play around with, if medieval history is your thing. "arenga_types.txt" is a guide to the arenga categories found in the database.</p><br><br><br>
