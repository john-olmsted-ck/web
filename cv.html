          <p><span class="pop">Software Engineer, <a href="http://creditkarma.com/">Credit Karma</a>, April 2015 - present</span></p>
          <p>Credit Karma builds tools that help millions of people keep track of their credit and achieve their financial goals. I work on a team that is currently spearheading a major redesign of our member support platform. I focus primarily on the backend, helping architect and implement a standalone JSON API for our administrative tools.

          <p><span class="pop">Software Engineer, <a href="http://newavenuehomes.com/">New Avenue</a>, May 2014 - April 2015</span></p>
          <p>New Avenue is a startup that streamlines the construction of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) to promote a more energy efficient form of growth. I am responsible for the design and development of core features on New Avenue's online platform, such as project planning, coordination, invoicing, and other interesting problems that require a complex yet loosely coupled architecture.</p>

          <p>I completed a nine week intensive course in web development with particular focus on Ruby on Rails. Including preparatory material I gained over 1000 hours of working experience in full stack development.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>As a web developer, I work full stack. Here's a representative list of the tools I use:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pop">Back end</span>: Rails, Sinatra/Padrino, PHP/Lumen, Node, PostgreSQL, MySQL</li>
          <li><span class="pop">Front end</span>: Backbone, jQuery, HTML, CSS</li>
          <li><span class="pop">Testing</span>: RSpec, Capybara, Mocha, PHPUnit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I try to follow these practices as much as possible:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Proven object-oriented design patterns</li>
          <li>A preference for pure, referentially transparent functions</li>
          <li>Test driven development</li>
          <li>Agile development</li>
          <li>I use version control for everything, even my personal notes</li>
          <li>Pair programming (when my coworkers let me)</li>
          <li>Refactoring code is my favorite part of programming</li>
          <li>Simplicity for simplicity's sake</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The best way to get a sense of I'm currently learning about is to <a href="https://github.com/qsymmachus/notes">read through my notes</a>, especially my <a href="https://github.com/qsymmachus/notes/blob/master/learning_log.txt">learning log</a>.</p>

        <h2>What I do for fun</h2>
        <p>I read a lot of history, the Latin classics, and books about animals. Physically, I enjoy barbell training, backpacking, playing squash, and bouldering (I max out at V2). My favorite lyricists are GZA and Method Man. Along with Maya Pincus, I maintain a collection of <a href="http://bugfacts.tumblr.com">bug facts</a>.</p>
